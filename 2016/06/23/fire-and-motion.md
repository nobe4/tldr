The mood for coding relates to the mood for eating, there is no really control.
Nearly 2-3h of productive work/day, why not from 12 to 17 only ?
The hard thing is to get the brain running, not to keep it still.
Fire and motion works for developping, even if code is buggy, you can fix it later.
Spend less time worrying and more time doing, it'll keep the motion.
Small constant increments will win eventually.
